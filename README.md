# Cryptography in Rust

Welcome to the **Cryptography in Rust** repository! This project showcases the implementation of various cryptographic ciphers in Rust. It serves as a learning resource for understanding how these algorithms work and how to implement them in a systems programming language like Rust.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number.
- **Vigenere Cipher**: A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword for encryption and decryption.

## Purpose

This repository is intended for **educational purposes** only. It is not designed for real-world cryptographic use, as the algorithms implemented here are not secure by modern standards. Instead, it focuses on:

- Learning Rust by working on hands-on projects.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of classical encryption techniques.
- Exploring the logic and mathematics behind cryptographic algorithms.
